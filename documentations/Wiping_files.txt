# Introduction

  Although it depends on the physical storage technology, I recommend to never use 
  /dev/zero because of residual magnetism and possible transparent compression.

  Note that if a hard drive marks a sector as bad, it cordons it off and the section becomes
  impossible to write to via software.

  Also, if the partition has been defragmented, resized or moved, or the file has been
  duplicated, the data will remain somewhere else.

  GNU core utilities :
  > man dd
  > man shred

  > man fdisk
  > man lsblk
  > man blkid



# Using dd

  Know the number of bytes to overwrite :
  > du --byte file_name | cut -f1

  Print the file's data in base64 :
  > base64 file_name
  > hexdump -C file_name

  Overwrite with peudo-random bytes :
  > dd bs=size_in_bytes count=1 iflag=fullblock status=progress if=/dev/urandom
     of=destination_file  
  Overwrite with zeros :
  > dd bs=size_in_bytes count=1 iflag=fullblock status=progress if=/dev/zero
     of=destination_file
  TODO : fullblock is not necessary since it's using an unblocking random source?

  Print the file's data in base64 (shows a different output) :
  > base64 file_name

  Remove the file :
  > rm file_name



# Using shred

  > shred -n 3 --random-source=/dev/urandom -u -v --exact --zero file_name
  
  (--exact : without changing the file size)



# TODO

  - add option dd form /dev/urandom or /dev/random for very secret files
  - Search the whole disk for the deleted left-over parts of the file and wipe them too without making any changes to other files and their traces.
