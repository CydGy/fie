- When decrypting, name the output filename as 1, 2, 3, etc. depending on the log. 

- why script moving-RNG-entropy.sh doesn't play sound when music already on ?
  and execute this script on shutdown

- Add a tool to erase data by overwriting

- Testing when not enough SRB available

- Colors

- Analytics containing dates for each encryption, so when encrypting a video, recommend multiple
  files to provide no info for the people spying

- Option to make it look like PDF or JPEG

- add a warning message when the user uses Windows

- if encrypting a video of 1GB, will the buffer trigger memory limit error? use only streams? try
  the error!

- Error if SRB < 4 (cause need RqRb) to encrypt 1 byte, need how much bytes?

- for lib/formatBytes.js master the Math's functions

- for lib/wipe.js master the drain event, else can have problems with big files and speed

- Archlinux

- man xxd

- Add autoremove option if epool special file

- if PRNG, do a stream as well because can cause error if max memory size attained. TEST!

- add option: On the MicroSD don't say the file is from which byte to which byte...
if someone succeeds to open the letter, they won't see a file...

- Streaming backwards :

- Make random bytes through voice audio
- Make an electronic project to create random bits

- for moving-RNG-entropy.sh show the output into the thing to know how many bytes have
  been moved
